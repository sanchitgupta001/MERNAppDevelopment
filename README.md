# MERN App Development
This repository contains basic app development using MERN stack.

**Node**: Javascript runtime used to execute code outside of the browser.

**Express**: Library that runs in the Node runtime. Has helpers to make dealing with HTTP traffic easier.

We are using passport.js for Google OAuth implementation.
Currently, only **Google OAuth** is implemented but later other OAuths can also be implemented.
For Mongo implementation, we are using **Mongoose** library.
For **MongoDB**, we are using database created at mlab.com.

To get started, you just need to do **npm install** to install dependencies for the project.
Also, you need to create a **config** folder containing **keys.js** for storing all your secret keys for Google OAuth, MongoDB, cookies, etc.
